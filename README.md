# McLarenSimulation
Simulation example developed for a technical Interview with McLaren.

The simulation mimics a ball being dropped through different fluids, gravity among other parameters. 
A more SOLID approach is also included, providing Unit testing and dependency injection to the original implementation among other improvements.
